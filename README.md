# TicTacToe

The project is a part of the course Software developement in Reykjavík University. It was carried out by four students, Gunnar Birnir Ólafsson, Hreinn Rúnarsson, Stefán Vilberg Leifsson and Védís Erna Eyjólfsdóttir. Their job was to implement the game TicTacToe in java, but the main focus was on the infrastructure and coding practices.
