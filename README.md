# The todo list is on the facebook group!!

## What is supposed to go into docs file?

* #### Documentation. The following report should all be stored in folder called docs on the root of the repository.

    * Development manual, that is, what is needed and how to get the project to build on a fresh machine
    * Source control client and access to source control
    * Build environment
    * Other necessary dependencies
* #### Administration manual, how to set it up and get it to run, also on a fresh machine.
    * How to install and run the program on clients machine (in case of simple desktop program)
    * How to deploy, run and maintain in case of client/server or web application.
    
* #### Design report
    * Document describing the initial design
    
* #### Coding rules
    * The code should be written in java. 
    * All class names should be written in __PascalCase__.
    * All function names should be written in __camelCase__.
    * All variable names should be written in __snake_case__.
    * All comments should be written in english.
    * All comments should begin with a space and end with a signature.
    * All comments should be written __above__ the code it refers to.
    
        ```java
        // I am a comment -John Smith
        int min_value = 0;
        return min_value;
        ```

    * Function and variable names should be descriptive
    * Brackets should __not__ be inline with the function name.
    
        ```java
        thisFunctionCalculatesSum(int a, int b)
        { 
            return a+b; 
        }
        ```
        
    * All if-statements and loops should have brackets, even though they only contain one line of code.
